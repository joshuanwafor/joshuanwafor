In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
 
He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers.

Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.

Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters,

and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills—
